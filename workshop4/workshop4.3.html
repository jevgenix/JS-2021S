    <h1>Workshop 4: DOM Scripting</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>In this exercise we will practice the art of DOM Scripting with JavaScript. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use. </p>
      <h2>Exercise 3: Images and pulldowns</h2>
    <li>Write a JavaScript function, which will fire when the pulldown menu item is changed. Show the users choice using alert -box.</li>
    <li>When the mouse is moved on top of the image, a colored border should appear surrounding it. On mouse out, border should disappear</li>
    <li>When you have accomplished the above, change the image (id=&quot;carimage&quot;) below based on the users choice on the pulldown menu below. Find appropriate images from the web.
      <p>Select a new car from the list.</p>
      <select name="mySelect" id="mySelect" onchange="">
        <option value="BMW">BMW         
        <option value="Audi">Audi
        <option value="Mercedes">Mercedes
        <option value="Volvo">Volvo
