    <h1>Workshop 4: DOM Scripting</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>In this exercise we will practice the art of DOM Scripting with JavaScript. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use. </p>
    
    <h2>Exercise 4: Moving things around</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="surprise">You can do neat things by editing CSS-rules via  JavaScript. See the examples in lecture slides. Then try these:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><button onclick="changePosition()">Move!</button>Select the div with an id &quot;carimage&quot; and move it 200px left and 500px down</li>
          <li><button onclick="setInterval(function(){doMove();},1000); "/>Animate</button> Write a  funtion doMove() which  will move the image across the screen, or even better: back and forth on  the screen. The Interval required has already been added to the onclick -event of the list item.</li>
          <li><button onclick="setInterval(function(){fadeOut();},250);"/>Fade out!</button> Wite  a function fadeOut() which will slowly decrease the opacity of the image from 1.0 to  0 making it fade out. The Interval required has already been added to the onclick -event of the list item</li>
          <li><button onclick="hide()"/>Disappear! </button>Finally, write JavaScript which will remove the image from the page</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
